This is an attempt to give the orphaned ontology at http://watson.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontologies/LT4eL/CSnCSv0.01Lex.owl a home since http://www.loa-cnr.it/ no longer exists.

Fortunately, prefixes dul, io, and own have other locations at "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#","http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl#", and "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/own/own16.owl#" respectively.

At least, this needs to be checked by comparing each line of dul.txt with DUL.owl, iolite.txt with IOLite.owl, and own.txt with own16.owl. 

The referenced ontologies are described more deeply in:
